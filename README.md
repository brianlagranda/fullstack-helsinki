# Fullstack - Helsinki - 2023

In this repo im learning new technologies to become a FullStack developer.

I'll be solving exercises given by the University of Helsinki.

The main focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js.

The technologies i'll be using are: React, Redux, Node.js, MongoDB, GraphQL and TypeScript.
